# a guide to markdown

Most of what I will talk about can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). (It probably explains it better than I do lol)

DocDepot allows you to upload your markdown documents to make them available to the world, but what is markdown? If you already know what markdown is, then visit the [doc depot guide](https://docdepot.vercel.app/guide) to learn how to use it.

## Overview

Markdown is a way to write styled pieces of text with basic syntax. You can use '#'s to make headings of different sized, '-'s to make lists, '*' to make text bold and italic, '[]()' to make links and more.

In just a few minutes you can write an extremely clear and cohesive piece of text which is enjoyable to read, just by using a few symbols.

### Paragraphs

A paragraph is the most basic element in a markdown document. It is just simply unstyled text. The words describing it here are a paragraph element.

### Headings

Headings are bold and much bigger than paragraphs and are use to break up your document into sections. From level 1 to 3 they get smaller.

The heading just above this paragraph is a heading level 3, while the heading at the very top of the page is a heading level 1.

- \# - Heading level 1
- \## - Heading level 2
- \### - Heading level 3

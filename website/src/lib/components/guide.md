# a guide to doc depot

DocDeopt is a very simple solution to upload your markdown files

In just a few steps, you can make your knowledge available to the whole world via Markdown and DocDepot.

### Step 1. Go to the upload page

Go to DocDepot's upload page at: [https://docdepot.com/upload](https://docdepot.com/upload)

### Step 2. Paste your markdown

From here, the page will show you the step by step on how to upload your file.

You will see two main boxes towards the top of the page. Paste your markdown into the box on the left and it will show you a preview in the box in the right. This is example how it will look like when it's uploaded.

### Step 3. Name your document

The next input box will ask you for a name for your document. This is the name by which people can access your document.

If you name your document `guide`, it will be found under the following URL: [https://docdepot.com/guide](https://docdepot.com/guide).

Everyone will be able to view it but I am working on features which will allow you to restrict viewership.

### Step 4. Protect your document

On the home page I state that you don't need to login in order to publish your markdown. This is true but also not very secure so, if you are not logged in, you need to provide a password.

This will be used if you want to edit/remove your document and when you want to add the document to your account. Once you add the document to your account, you can edit/remove it without having to enter the password.

### Step 5. Upload your document

There will be a button at the bottom of the page which you should press. Your document is now published.

As mentioned earlier, it will be found at \[https://docdepot.com/view/<name\>\](https://docdepot.com/guide), and it will give you the URL when you upload.

**And that's it**. This is supposed to be a very simple tool at this point, and will stay this way for a while.

## Future of DocDepot

That being said, I have loads of ideas for features that I want to implement in the near future.

These include:
- Markdown editor
- Restricted viewership
- Document analytics
- Custom styling for documents
- LaTeX syntax
- Document groups for things like blogs and documentation

If you have any features you want me to add or bugs you want me to fix, don't hesitate to reach out on twitter or open an issue on github.
